# 27Apr17 Rails: API-only Applications { level: "beginner" }

Join us this month as DL discusses creating API-only applications with rails.

We'll setup a new Rails API project. Along the way we'll learn various configuration
options, why you would or wouldn't want to create an API-only project, and some
of the differences between a typical rails project and API-only one.

In addition to learning about setting up an API-only app, we'll learn how Postman
and Swagger::Blocks can help us develop our API.

This talk will set the stage for upcoming talks as well as our first workshop so
be sure to stay tuned!
