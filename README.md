# monthly talks

each month we'll update this repo with information provided by the speaker, as well as relevant links and documentation coming out of those talks.

for continuity, let's aim for the following structure to this repo:

```monthly_talks
|-- talk
|   |-- README.md
|   |-- presentation
|   |   |-- presentation.ppt
|   |-- code_examples
|   |   |-- file.rb```
