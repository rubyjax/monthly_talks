# itegrate with a mail service (mailgun)

this task has is to exercise two common developer skills:
* pair programming, with a random person
* on-the-fly integration with a mailing service(we will use mailgun)

## pair programming

taped underneath the table is a small envelope. inside are two items, a raffle 
ticket (for later) and a number. the number corresponds with the same number on
another envelope. this is your pair partner.

get together with your partner and follow these instructions:

_in any language you choose_, use the [mailgun reference](https://documentation.mailgun.com/api_reference.html#api-reference) to build a
module with the following interface requirements,

* send emails with a subject, text and campaign id to any email address
* detect if an email address is listed in a suppression (do not contact) list
* get the list of previously sent emails to a given email address

oh, and of course... write tests

you will have one hour
