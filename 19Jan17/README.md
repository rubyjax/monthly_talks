# 19Jan17 - DL Cummings { RubyJax and 2017: What's Next? }

You've probably heard RubyJax is under new leadership and have questions: Are we
changing the date (no)? Will we start charging (no)?

During this talk I'll discuss some of the exciting things to come in 2017 for the 
RubyJax+ community. I'll introduce the new organizers and speak about the expectations
all members can look forward to.

Afterwards, since the talk won't take terribly long, we'll dive right in with a fun
exercise to sharpen our minds and pair programming skills!

Hope to see you there!
