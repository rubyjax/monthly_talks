# 16Mar17 Tune Up Your Ruby App { level: "intermediate"­ }

John is a ruby dev with Perl experience and a focus on building automation solutions.
This month he'll be discussing application performance and methods for giving your 
app a tune-up before it becomes unwieldy:

One of the challenges we may encounter as an application grows in size and complexity
is application performance. This talk will cover how we can tune up our Ruby code by
looking at:

1. Converting our views from using HAML to ERB (or Slim) 
2. Evaluating the data structures we are using 
3. Using Ruby Prof to track down bottlenecks 
4. Optimizing our use of Strings (use Constants)

Note: While the topic is intermediate level, there will be plenty of opportunity for
novice level devs to participate. This is merely a heads up not an expectation of participants.

John also blogs over at [OGNT](http://ognt.io).
